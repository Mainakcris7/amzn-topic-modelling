# Amazon Review Topic Modelling

In the task of topic modeling for Amazon reviews, I employed `Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)` and `Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)` techniques to segment the reviews into six distinct topics. These topics include discussions on `Amazon Alexa Devices and Audio Control`, `Amazon Kindle and E-Readers`, `Streaming Devices and Content Consumption`, `Amazon Echo Accessories and Customization`, `Portable Bluetooth Speakers`, and `Family Gift Purchase and Enjoyment`. By utilizing these techniques, I successfully identified the main themes within the reviews, allowing for better understanding and categorization of customer feedback and preferences across various Amazon product categories.
